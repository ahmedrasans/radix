                    <h3><strong>TESTING AND
                        COMMISSIONING</strong></h3>
                    <h3>Protection from Solar Degradation</h3>
                    <p>The pipeline may be tested as a whole or in
                        sections, depending on the diameter and
                        length of the pipe, the spacing between sectioning
                        valves or blank ends and the availability of water.
                        Pipelines should be bedded and backfilled, but
                        with the joints left uncovered for inspection before
                        and after testing if possible.
                        All thrust supports for fittings and valves must
                        be finished and the concrete properly cured (the
                        minimum time is seven days). Blank ends installed
                        temporarily should be adequately supported to
                        take the pressure thrust.
                        Fill the pipeline with water and remove air from the
                        system as far as possible. Allow the temperature to
                        stabilise..</p>
                    <p>Pressurise the system. Selection of field test
                        pressures is related to the system operating
                        conditions. A maximum test pressure of 1.25
                        times the system design pressure, measured at the
                        lowest point in the system, is specified although
                        the test pressure should not exceed 1.25 times the
                        PN of the lowest rated component in the system.
                        Additional water will be required to bring the line
                        up to pressure because the pipe expands slightly.
                        Recommends that the pressurised pipe should
                        be allowed to stand for a minimum period of 15
                        minutes without make up pressure. Where the
                        joints are available for inspection, and there is no
                        evidence of leaks after 15 minutes, the pipeline is
                        deemed to have passed the test.</p>
                    <p>Where joints are not acces- sible, measure the
                        amount of water required to re-pressurise the
                        108 DUBAI PLAST | TECHNICAL MANUAL
                        section. Where the make- up water does not
                        exceed the allowance in the equation 4.1
                        below, the pipeline is deemed to have passed
                        the test. The make-up water is not a leakage
                        allowance. It is normal for a pressure drop to
                        occur as the remaining air goes into solution
                        and some further expansion of the pipe
                        occurs..</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="about-flex-2">
                <p>Q =0.14 LDH (4.1)
                    Where: <br>
                    Q = allowable make-up water (l/h)<br>
                    L = length of the test section (km)<br>
                    D = nominal diameter of the pipe (m)<br>
                    H = average test head over the test length (m)<br>
                    <br>
                    This simple test above should suffice if the
                    pipe is well supported by soil. If however, the
                    allowable make up water level is exceeded, it
                    does not necessarily mean that the pipeline
                    has a leak. Viscoelastic creep of the pipe
                    can give result in a drop in pressure even
                    if there is no leak, particularly for higher
                    strain pipes such as PVC-M and PVC-O if
                    the soil compaction levels are not high. In
                    this situation, further testing will be required
                    to verify the leak tightness of the test
                    section. This testing is based on the known
                    relationship between creep strain and time.<br>
                    Re-pressurise the pipe and maintain the
                    pressure for 5 hours by successively pumping
                    in sufficient water at the same temperature
                    (±3°C) as the water in the pipeline. Measure
                    and record the volume (V1) of water required
                    between the second and third hour. Measure
                    and record the volume (V2) of water required
                    between the fourth and fifth hour. The
                    pipeline is deemed to have passed the test if<br><br>
                    the following equation is satisfied:<br>
                    V2 =0.55 V1 + Q (4.2)<br>
                    Where Q is the allowable make-up water from (4.1)<br>
                    It should be borne in mind that static
                    pressure testing does not necessarily simulate
                    pressures developed under operating
                    conditions, and in order to obtain adequate
                    testing of all parts of the line it may be
                    desirable to divide it into sections.</p>

                <p><strong>Metal Detectable Tapes</strong><br>
                    The use of metal detectable tapes is now
                    common. These offer the dual facility of a
                    colour-coded early warning visual marker
                    during excavation and traceability of the pipe
                    when the precise location is not known.
                    The tape is placed on top of the pipe surround
                    material and can later be located by using
                    simple metal detectors operat- ing in the 4-20
                    MHz range at depths ranging to 450 - 600
                    mm depending on equipment.<br>
                    <strong>Trace Wires</strong><br>
                    Trace wires are useful where pipes are buried
                    significantly deeper. The trace wire is usu- ally
                    laid under the pipe, to avoid damage, and
                    when a suppressed current is applied it can
                    be detected at depths up to 3 metres using
                    commercially available inductive detectors.
                    Suitable trace wires are the vinyl-coated single
                    copper wire conductors for convey- ance of an
                    electric current. Disadvantages of the system
                    are that both ends of the wire have to be
                    accessed to apply the current, and if the wire
                    is broken the system cannot be used.<br>
                    <strong>Audio Detection</strong><br>
                    Several excellent audio leak detectors are
                    now available. One type requires an acoustic
                    signal to be introduced to the pipe at some
                    convenient location, e.g. a hydrant. A tuned
                    detector is then used to locate the pipeline.
                    These units are still effective with high
                    background noise levels.<br>
                    A second type picks up the sound of
                    turbulence from flowing water in the
                    pipe. This must be done in the absence of
                    extraneous background noise, particularly
                    traffic sounds. Skilled operators can also
                    pinpoint the location of fittings. The
                    equipment can also be used</p>
